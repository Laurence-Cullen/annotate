Hi Nathan!

I think this will be easier to install on a Unix system if you have one handy :)

As an external dependancy I have the Darknet ml framework, to install that run:

cd ~/<br/>
git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet.git<br/>
cd darknet<br/>
make<br/>

To test the darknet install run:<br/>
./darknet

You should get the output:<br/>
usage: ./darknet <function>
