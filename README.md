Hi Nathan!

I think this will be easier to install on a Unix system if you have one handy :)

As an external dependancy I have the Darknet ml framework, to install that run:

```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet.git
cd darknet
make
```

To test the darknet install run:<br/>
```
./darknet
```

You should get the output:<br/>
```
usage: ./darknet <function>
```

if the install has completed successfully.
If you hit any problems take a look at the darknet [project page](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/install/).
