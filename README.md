Hi Nathan!

I think this will be easier to install on a Unix system if you have one handy :)

As an external dependancy I have the Darknet ml framework, to install that run:

cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet.git
cd darknet
make

To test the darknet install run:
./darknet

You should get the output:
usage: ./darknet <function>
